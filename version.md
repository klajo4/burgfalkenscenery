## Version 1.1.0:

**finished**
- Written a blender python script, to produce the required mqo file from blender scene.  
  Writes a very simplyfied mqo format, since the mqo-to-tgc converter ignores most   
  of the scene/object properties anyway.
- Created CollisionObjects:
	- Groundgrid (not perfect, needs refinement later)
	- Some trees (not all, so far)
	- Huts and hedges
- Adjusted north direction and altitude 
- Defined startpositions for airplanes and gliders (with winsh).

**to be done**
- Implement missing trees 
- Define starting positions for helis
- Define positions for contests (Limbo, baloon..)
- Refine groundgrid (optional)
