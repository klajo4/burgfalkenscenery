Its purpose is, to add some proper collision objects to this beautiful panorama.

## Install
**RC7:**  
To install the scenery, extract the following zip file   
https://github.com/klajo4/burgfalkenscenery/releases/download/v_1.3.0.1/rc7-burgfalken.zip

into the user-scenery folder of your local Aerofly RC7 installation  
```C:\Benutzer\…..\Dokumente\aeroflyRC7\scenery``` 

**RC8:**  
To install the scenery, extract the following zip file   
https://github.com/klajo4/burgfalkenscenery/releases/download/v_1.3.0.1/rc8-burgfalken.zip

into the user-scenery folder of your local Aerofly RC8 installation

## Update
Same as Install, because all textures have changed in Versin 1.3.0. 
Just confirm overwriting the existing files.



After restarting Aerofly, you'll find the new/updated scenery in the user defined sceneries
